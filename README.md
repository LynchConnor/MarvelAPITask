# MarvelAPITask

## The Task
- Your task is to create a 'superhero squad' app, using the Marvel API for data.
- Users should be able to browse a list of all characters from the Marvel API and add up to five characters to their squad.
- The app structure should be simple. When opened, it should show your current 'squad' - if any - and a list of all characters from the Marvel API. Users should be able to select a character, showing their details, and giving you the option to 'recruit' them to your squad, or 'fire' them from it.
